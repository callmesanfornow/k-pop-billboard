[Verse 1: Jennie & Lisa]
Kick in the door, waving the coco
팝콘 이나 챙겨 껴들 생각 말고
I talk that talk, runways I walk, walk
눈 감고 pop, pop 안 봐도 척
One by one, then two by two
내 손끝 툭 하나에 다 무너지는 중
가짜 쇼 치곤 화려했지
Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar outta me

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
자 오늘 밤이야
난 독을 품은 꽃
네 혼을 빼앗은 다음
Look what you made us do
천천히 널 잠재울 fire (Fire)

This that pink venom, this that pink venom
This that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em

[Verse 2: Lisa & Jennie]
Black paint and ammo, got bodies like Rambo
Rеst in peace, please light up a candle, this the life of a vandal
Masked up and I'm still in CELINE
Designer crimes or it wouldn't be me (Ooh)
Diamonds shinin', drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
And I'm wildin', stylin' on them and there's no chance
'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance

Yeah, 넌 아쉬울 때만
Yeah, 그저 아쉬울 때만 날
Yeah, 그래 아쉬울 때라도 너라면 좋으니까
이젠 기다릴 것도 없잖아
겁낼 필요도 없잖아
네 심장의 색깔을 보여줘
정말 내 세상엔 네가 필요해
두 눈을 떠봐 네 앞에

I'm ready for love
Tell me when you ready 'cause I'm already ready (Ready, ready)

I'm ready for love, I'm ready for love
Ready or not, here I come and I'm running
Like it's now or never, I never know if you want it
What if love wasn't what it was supposed to be?
What if there's no Romeo for me?
No hope, no roses, no more notes to read
So I keep my eyes closed to see
What I need is forever and forever, baby, not sometimes
When you want it, then you best come find me 'cause I'm ready
이젠 기다릴 것도 없잖아
