Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty

[Chorus]
This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways

[Verse 1]
Mix me with the drama (Drama)
Check you like commas (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
My clothes are pajamas ('Jamas)
Straight from the cold plunge (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Daytime baddie use her mind
Quick switch of the fit for the night (Night)
Swеrvin' through the lane, we'll bе twenty minute late
'Cause we had to do an In-N-Out drive-by

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not that deep (Deep), I'm not that drunk (Drunk)
Sometimes, girls just gotta have fun
Throw it back, all that ass
Me and my sis, way too attached
It's not that deep (Deep), we're not that dumb (Dumb)
Look at them Bonnies on the run
Inside glowin' like the sun (Sun, s—)

To be off of the grid like all night
Oh, with my bih, like (Bitch, like)

They can't deal with me 'cause I'm priceless
여러 셀럽들 속에 내 DNA
Get, get outta my way
바비가 처키가 되기 전에
Name, shame, blame tryna burst my bubble
터트려봐 그럼 더 큰 홀에서
만나는 거야 제니를 keep shading

I try to stop, but I can't think
About anything else but you (But you)
And I'm a little too buzzed on your love to play it cute

Can't eat, sleep, baby, it's true (It's true)
Tryna bite my lip, I'm probably gonna slip
And say some crazy shit to you

I trip and fall in love
Just like a Tuesday drunk
I always go all in, all in, all in
Over the handlebars
Hitting the ground so hard
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin' (Fallin', yeah)

[Outro: Dua Lipa & JENNIE]
We ain't gotta talk about
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Yeah)
We ain't gotta talk about
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
We ain't gotta talk about it","Mercy
Why is it love is never kind to me? (Me)
I heard that fools rush in and, yeah, that's me (Me)
It burns me time and time again
So why am I still fixing for this frying pan (Thinkin')
I wonder what you're doing for tonight and forever (Oh-oh)
I could be the rest of your life or whatever
My lips and your lips, we could press them together (Together, 'gether)
I don't ever think twice, and, baby, that's why
I trip and fall in love
Just like a Tuesday drunk
I always go all in, all in, all in
Over the handlebars
Hitting the ground so hard
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin'
Another round, another drink
I try to stop, but I can't think
About anything else but you (But you)
And I'm a little too buzzed on your love to play it cute
A single kiss, I lost my mind for seven days and seven nights
Can't eat, sleep, baby, it's true (It's true)
Tryna bite my lip, I'm probably gonna slip
And say some crazy shit to you
I wonder what you're doing for tonight and forever (Oh-oh)
I don't ever think twice, and, baby, that's why
I trip and fall in love
Just like a Tuesday drunk
I always go all in, all in, all in
Over the handlebars
Hitting the ground so hard
If I'm alone, fallin', fallin', fallin' (Fallin', yeah)

I'm over, I'm so over
This love hangover (Yeah, go)

[Verse 1: JENNIE & Dominic Fike]
Fight me, fight me, fight me
You made me so unlike me
I don't wanna talk, come behind me
Know you ain't the one, but you might be
Who sent you? Who sent you? Who sent you?
Who sent you 'round again? (Who sent you 'round?)
I'm so, l'm so shady
I don't really mind when you play me
Wanna switch it up, go crazy
I ain't gonna leave 'til you hate me
Who sent you? Who sent you? Who sent you?
Who sent you 'round? (Who sent you 'round?)

[Chorus: JENNIE]
We say it's over (Uh)
But I keep fucking with you (Yeah)
And every time I do, I wake up with this love hangover
You got me pourin' for two
I swore l'd never do it again
Until you came over (Uh)
I started lying with you (Yeah)
And every time I do, I wake up with this love hangover, ah-oh
I swear I'll never do it again


[Post-Chorus: JENNIE]
Ah, shit, I did it again (Call me back, call me back, call me back)
Oh-oh-oh, but you know l'm gonna do it again (Oh, shit, oh, shit, call me back, call me back, call me back)
Yeah, you know I'm gonna do it again

[Verse 2: Dominic Fike, JENNIE, Both]
I had woke up in a daze, my sweat was cold, my lip was cracked
I can't leave this bitch, I had to single, double, triple back
She gon' leave me, but she wants to keep me on, what's up with that?
I don't even really got time for all that shit right now, l'm a baby father
And all them jokes she told at dinner last night ain't had me dead, I was playing possum
And when the waiter brought the check, she said, ""Let's head to mine"" I said, ""Okay, awesome""
One minute, we're growin' apart, and next, I'm in her apartment
Just watchin' her get naked and not thinkin' with my heart
I ain't even really got time for all that shit right now
But if she wanted it right now
Then I could meet you there right now (Now, now, now, now)
Even though you barely even drink (Uh-huh), we hardly even spoke (Uh-huh)
But I know when I wake up that I'm still gon' feel that hangover, babe

[Chorus: JENNIE]
We say it's over (Uh)
But I keep fucking with you (Yeah)
And every time I do, I wake up with this love hangover (Uh-huh)
You got me pourin' for two (Uh-huh)
