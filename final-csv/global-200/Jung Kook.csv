One, two, 3D

[Verse 1: Jung Kook]
I can't touch you through the phone
Or kiss you through the universe
In another time zone
It's the only time I can't reverse
But when there's two dimensions
There's only one I'm missin'
And if you feel alone
You don't have to feel that no more

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
So if you're ready (So if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Uh-uh)
You won't regret me (You won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagnе confetti)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D


[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)
You know how I likе it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)

[Verse 2: Jung Kook]
Body to body to body to body to body
You and me, baby, you know that we got it
So don't go gettin' me started
'Cause you know I get hot-hearted
Baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, you makin' me crazy
Rain, rain, rain, you can't fake it
You give me brand-new emotion
You got me drinkin' that potion

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
So if you're ready (So if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Hey, show me, girl, now)
You won't regret me (You won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti, hey)
I wanna see it in motion

[Verse 3: Jack Harlow]
I'm on my Jung Kook, take a chick off one look
And when they get took, they don't ever get untook (Woo)
When I seen that body, you would think it was a dead body
The way I told my boys, ""Come look""
I used to take girls up to Stony Brook
And steal they hearts like some crook, true story
Now when I hold somebody's hand, it's a new story
All my ABGs get cute for me
I had one girl (One girl), too boring
Two girls (Two girls), that was cool for me
Three girls, damn, dude's horny
Four girls, okay, now you whorin'
(Hey, hey, hey) I'm loose
I done put these shrooms to good use
I done put my city on my back
And the world know my name, I'm the truth

And if you'll let me

Paint you likе the villain that you never wеre
I'm gonna blame you
For things that you don't do
Hating you's the only way it doesn't hurt
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
It's not the truth
It's not the cure
But hating you's the only way it doesn't hurt",M,S

Tell me, am I ever gonna feel again?
Tell me, am I ever gonna heal again?
Got a shot glass full of tears
Drink, drink, drink, say ""Cheers""
I got all these diamonds running down my face
And I ain't letting any of 'em go to waste
Got a shot glass full of tears

[Verse 1]
She the life of the party
Forty-two in her body
She's got some dangerous hobbies
Like chasing after the sun
And making me fall in love
Till I'm sick to my stomach (Sick to my stomach)
Until I throw back a dozen
Until I'm driving a hundred
With my hands off the wheel
Just to see how it feels

[Verse 2]
It's a hard pill to swallow
This emotion I bottle
Need something strong for the sorrow
Something strong for the pain
So, I can wash it away
I was cold, now, I'm freezing (Cold, now, I'm freezing)
Stuck in a permanent season (Permanent season)
And we both know you're the reason (Know you're the reason)
I'm not the same as before
I don't feel anymore

Same back roads
Switching lanes
My mind is racing
I can drive myself insane

And summer's strange

Last week, I found a message in a bottle
It said go home, ain't nobody love you no more
I can't disagree
So, last night, I went to the club
Had a couple too many threw up
Now, everybody's laughing at me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm way too sad
Way too sad to dance
I'm way too sad to dance

[Chorus]
'Cause I got too caught up, my friends agree
A broken heart and nobody
And that's why I'm too sad to dance
And now, I just wait by the telephone
You ain't coming back and I should've known
And that's why I'm too sad to dance

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, da-da-dum-da-da-da, da-da-dum-da-da-dum
That's why I'm too sad to dance

[Verse 2]
This morning, I knocked your door
Just to admit my flaws
But you said you've heard it all before, mmm
And this Christmas, I got no gifts
Do I really deserve all this?
So, I head straight down to the liquor store, uh-uh

So, I called up my pops last night
He said by the morning light
You won't need no romance
He told me, walk that walk alone
And talk that talk, you know

[Intro]
날 스치는 그대의 옅은 그 목소리
내 이름을 한 번만 더 불러주세요
얼어버린 노을 아래 멈춰 서있지만
그대 향해 한 걸음씩 걸어갈래요
Still with you

[Verse 1]
어두운 방 조명 하나 없이
익숙해지면 안 되는데
그게 또 익숙해
나지막이 들리는
이 에어컨 소리
이거라도 없으면
나 정말 무너질 것 같아

[Pre-Chorus]
함께 웃고 함께 울고
이 단순한 감정들이
내겐 전부였나 봐
언제쯤일까
다시 그댈 마주한다면?
눈을 보고 말할래요
보고 싶었어요


[Chorus]
황홀했던 기억 속에
나 홀로 춤을 춰도 비가 내리잖아
이 안개가 걷힐 때쯤
젖은 발로 달려갈게
그때 날 안아줘

[Verse 2]
저 달이 외로워 보여서
밤하늘에 환하게 울고 있는 것 같아서
언젠가 아침이 오는 걸 알면서도
별처럼 너의 하늘에 머물고 싶었어

[Pre-Chorus]
하루를 그 순간을
이렇게 될 걸 알았다면
더 담아뒀을 텐데

젖은 발로 달려갈게

[Outro]
날 바라보는 희미한 미소 뒤편에
아름다운 보랏빛을 그려볼래요
서로 발걸음이 안 맞을 수도 있지만
그대와 함께 이 길을 걷고 싶어요

[Verse 1]
Summer has already spread in the air
Breeze is already blowing
The last cold snap is going out
The days were getting longer and longer
But my days were still going on, and on, and on
I got wet in the sun shower and looked up at the night sky

[Verse 2]
It was quite a lonely night
In the blink of an eye
The dark faded out
Blooming under the sunlight
Memories with me and you

[Chorus]

All these times are precious due to you

Four scents wеre left 'cause of you

Thankful to be by your side now
I'll try to shine brighter than now

사라질까
혹시 꿈일까
뒤척이다
또 잠이 든다
영원할 수 있을까
사무친 이 맘
달래어 보다
밤에 잠겨 감긴다
