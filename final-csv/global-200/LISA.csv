[Intro]
내 뒷모습만 봐도 알잖아
어두워질 때 분홍빛이나
새하얀 조명이 날 깨우면
번쩍번쩍 세상을 흔들어 (Hey!)
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la
What's my name? What's my name? (Hey!)
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la
What's my name? What's my name?

[Verse 1]
머리를 하얗게 비운채
시끄런 감정은 태울래
Burn, burn, burn
그때 난 네 갈증을 해소할 champagne
Sip, sip, 나를 들이켜
그래 더 저 높이 내 body 받들어

[Pre-Chorus]
Want you to ring the alarm, 세상에게 알려
내 이름에다 입맞춰


[Chorus]
Say, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)
Call me, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)
Oh-ooh, 알잖아 attitude

Call me, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)
Oh-ooh, 알잖아 attitude
뭘 더 어쩌라구, the loudest in the room (Hoo!)

[Verse 2]
Baby, get the megaphone, put it on speaker
I said I can't hear you, so you need to speak up
Put that shit on stereo, everyone else on very low
Protect it like a barrier, promise there's nothing scarier
Than me if anybody coming gunnin' for my man
Gonna catch a case, gun up in my hand
Bam, bam, bam! Hit after hit though
Rocks in my wrist, so I call 'em the Flintstones

[Pre-Chorus]
Ring the alarm, 세상에게 알려
내 이름에다 입맞춰

[Bridge]
누구와도 비교 못해 그래봤자
You gon' still love me
You need some L-A-L-I-S-A
지금 너의 두 눈 앞에 서있는
내 이름을 기억해
Love you some L-A-L-I-S-A
(Hoo!)

[Verse 3]
You cannot see me, 어떻게 하는지 다 보여줘도 (No)
태국에서 한국 거쳐 여기까지, went for the throat (The throat)
Being the greatest of all time ain't fantasy (Woo!)
새까만 핑크빛 왕관 belongs to we (BLACKPINK)

Down, down, rude boy, get your foot up on my dash
Got all the receipts, I'm a businesswoman
Littlе bit of heartbreak
A little bit of ""How could you do that?""
A littlе bit of talkin' out your ass
A little bit of ""Look at what you had but could not hold""
And that's on you, baby, too bad
I'm about to make it heard as I vroom-vroom
Ice-cold how I leave you ’lone, but please
Tell your mother I’ma miss her so

Nice to leave ya
But I would be a fool not to ask
Do your words seem gospel to ya now? (Your words seem gospel to you now?)
Keepin' me strong
Choosin' to carry on after one
Too many lies would be wrong, so wrong
Said, he popped tags on my shoppin' spree
Stayed mad when I showed him all the long receipts
They laugh, but you crashed out like a comedy
I can't be your sugar mom, get a job for me, shit
(Ah, so) Boy, let go
Or let me live happily forever after more
I hope you learned somethin' from a lil' fiasco
You played the game smart lettin' lil' me pass go 'cause

[Chorus: LISA & RAYE]
If you tried just a little more times
I would've made you a believer
Would've showed you what it's like (Like)
Every single night (Night)
To be born again, baby, to be born again
If you stayed just another few nights
I could've made you pray to Jesus
Would've showed you to the light (To the light)
Every single night (Every night)
To be born again, baby, to be born again


[Bridge: RAYE]
Seasoned like the cinnamon the way I'm gettin' rid of him
I'm only gonna make you need religion at the minimum
And I'ma do it diligent, I'm lookin' for a synonym
I'm tryna find the words to tell him I ain't even feelin' him (I pray)
Don't ever let me be deficient in
Wish that you could wake up and then take me like a vitamin
I learned the hard way to let go now to save my soul (Oh)

[Chorus: RAYE & LISA, LISA, RAYE]
If you tried just a little more times
I would've made you a believer
Would've showed you what it's like (Like)
Every single night
To be born again, baby, to be born again
If you stayed just another few nights
I could've made you pray to Jesus
Would've showed you to the light (To the light)
Every single night (Every night)
To be born again, baby, to be born again

[Outro: LISA, LISA & RAYE]
Baby, to be born, oh, baby, baby, to be born again
To be born again, baby, to be born again
Baby, to be born, oh, baby, baby, to be born again (Yeah)
To be born again, baby, to be born again","In the car, top down, black shades on, uh (Lookin’ so good, can I add?)
And I just broke up with my man, like mm (A very, very silly, silly man)
One ex in the passenger seat 'cause I'm done (Done, yeah, never, ever goin' back)
Down, down, rude boy, get your foot up on my dash
Got all the receipts, I'm a businesswoman
Littlе bit of heartbreak
A little bit of ""How could you do that?""
A littlе bit of talkin' out your ass
A little bit of ""Look at what you had but could not hold""
And that's on you, baby, too bad
I'm about to make it heard as I vroom-vroom
Ice-cold how I leave you ’lone, but please
Tell your mother I’ma miss her so
If you tried just a little more times
I would've made you a believer
Would’ve showed you what it's like (Like)
Every single night
To be born again, baby, to be born again
If you stayed just another few nights
I could've made you pray to Jesus
Would've showed you to the light (To the light)
Every single night (Every night)
To be born again, baby, to be born again
Non-believer
You’ve bitten from the fruit but can't give back
Nice to leave ya
But I would be a fool not to ask
Do your words seem gospel to ya now? (Your words seem gospel to you now?)
Keepin' me strong
Choosin' to carry on after one
Too many lies would be wrong, so wrong

[Refrain: LISA]
(Yeah) Uh, uh, woke up in that mode again
(Yeah) Uh, uh, please don't call my phone again
(Yeah) Uh, uh, walked in causing havoc
Yes, that is a habit
Bad, I'm bad, I'm tragic, yeah

[Verse 1: LISA]
They watch me on the stages (Stages), they watch me goin' crazy (Crazy)
I'm 'bout to make 'em pick the pieces up, then lock 'em in the cages (Cages)
A lot can happen in a couple minutes, lots of reasons, lots of things in action
Lots of people watchin' things unravel, watch the moment, watch me go in
Locked and loaded, say some shit that'll make 'em think it, thought-provoking
Only do things that are makin' history, try to make moves that'll make 'em miss me
Stay as busy as I want to, takin' trips to escape a bit
Make it shift to a different gear, takin' things to a different tier
Pop up with it on the roof like a proper villain
All this spendin' got me in a mood, driven by the vision
I've been livin', sittin' pretty, pretty 'fits and pretty cities
Busy, busy, uh, really gettin' busy with it, giddy up

[Refrain: LISA]
(Yeah) Uh, uh, woke up in that mode again
(Yeah) Uh, uh, please don't call my phone again

[Chorus: LISA & Future]
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world, fuck up the world
I think I just might, might
Fuck up the world, fuck up the world
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world, fuck up the world
I think I just might
I think—, I think— I just—, I just— (Pluto)

[Verse 2: Future]
Woke up, splurgin' racks (Woah)
I secured another bag (For sure)
Skateboard LVP (Hey)
Causin' havoc when I'm in the streets (Yeah)
Passport stamped, overseas (Yeah)
Tycoon life of a G
All a shorty wanted was a Birkin
All this money comin', you deserve it
Fresh, clean, but I'm drinkin' dirty
Chopped the 'Rari, chopped it to a 'vert (Woo)
I secure the Lamb' chop first
Feel like I'm the greatest show on Earth
Whipped the Phantom, came back in a spurt
Patek water, ready on surf
This the type of mood I'm in again
Diamonds on me, doin' it again (Yeah)
Princess cuts lit up for the win
Poppin' out on one on one again (Poppin' out)
High fashion, settin' trend
Ayy, say, ayy, say twin (Ayy, say twin)
Lot of freestyles, no pen (Yeah)
Top dog, got to go big

[Bridge: LISA]
Rappin' like my lease up, I told them that I'm focused (Yeah, yeah)
They want the old LISA, then listen to my old shit (Yeah, yeah)
Rappin' like a deep cut, flowin' like the ocean (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
They want the old LISA, then listen to my old shit

[Chorus: LISA]
Woke up feelin' like, like
Fuck up the world, fuck up the world

Fuck up the world, fuck up the world
