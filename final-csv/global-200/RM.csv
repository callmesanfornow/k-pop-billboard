난 still life, but I'm movin'
Just live now, goin' forward, yeah
멈추지 않는 정물, huh
또 피워 나의 꽃을
Gimme no name 'cause I'm untitled
계속 전시되는 내 삶 (Huh, yeah)
그래도 삶 아직도 삶 (What? Mm)

[Pre-Chorus: RM]
과건 가버렸고 미랜 모르네 (Oh-oh)
두 갈래길에서 숨 고르네
벗어나고 싶어 이 캔버스의 틀 (Oh-oh)
어제와 내일이 내게 드리운 그늘
난 그저 담담하게 live errtime (Oh-oh)
24/7 yeah, baby, I’m on time
난 그저 오늘을 살아 1분 1초마다
가진 전불 다 걸어
What you know about me, huh?

Errday is my day one, brother
Baby 난 돈으로 시간을 벌어
걔네 조롱은 듣지 마 니 귀 버려
꼭 버러지들 온라인에 목숨 걸어
Trendsetter? I'm a friend, better
식상해질 정도의 go-and-getter
결국 니가 원하는 대론 되지 않았지
바램관 달리 너무 잘 살아대네 내 뜻대로, huh
(Ninety-four) livin' in 한남대로
(Ninety-one) look at my 탄탄대로
갈 일이 없어 이젠 강남대로
월세 밀린 넌 빨리 당장 방 빼고
What a poor flex, hon', look at your chain
Me rather do it like, ""Look at my stain""
오늘을 살아 잡초처럼
걍 화초처럼 but I never stay
