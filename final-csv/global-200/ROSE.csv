My life's been magic, seems fantastic
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
Funny when you want it, suddenly you have it
You find out that your gold's just plastic

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, every night
I've been thinkin' back on you and I
Every day, every night

[Chorus]
I worked my whole life
Just to get right, just to be like
""Look at me, I'm never comin' down""
I worked my whole life
Just to get high, just to realise
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground

But I've been wakin' up with your voice in my head
And I'm tryna send a message and let you know
That every single minute I'm without you, I regret it

Call us what we are, toxic from the start
Can't pretend that I was in the dark
When you met my friends, didn't even try with them
I should've known right then

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'

[Chorus]
Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, ""I never wanna see your face""
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end
Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
You heard, ""Baby, can you pull me in closеr?""
You were plotting how to stay in my head
Wе were toxic till the end

Ladies and gentlemen
I present to you
The ex


[Verse 2]
His favourite game is chess, who would ever guess?
Playing with the pieces in my chest
Now he's on the screen and saying, ""Don't leave""
You stole that line from me

For not giving me back my Tiffany rings
I'll never forgive you for one thing, my dear
You wasted my prettiest years

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh

[Verse 1]
I just saw a red flag
Gonna pretend I didn't see that
'Cause is it really, really that bad?
I need you really, really that bad
So, can we keep this story rolling?
Forget that shit my mother always told me
'Cause nothing's really perfect like that
I need you really, really that bad

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you really, really that bad

[Chorus]
The one I run to
Take my makeup off and say goodnight to
The one I pretty talk and ugly-cry to
The world can roll their eyes, but there's no use
I just want it to be you
When it's 3 a.m.​
And I'm losing mysеlf in my mind again
The one who gives mе love that is bulletproof
The world can roll their eyes, but there's no use

[Verse 2]
Hold me, kiss me on my face
Talk shit about the world with me all day
And even when I'm putting you through hell
Say I'm not like anyone else
Slowly, words roll off my tongue
You're everything I need and it's so dumb
And even when you're putting me through hell
You're not like anyone else

If crying was fun, I'll be having the time of my life
If loving you was a jump, yeah, I probably died a hundred-ten times
Gave you my favourite memories

Two years, now I understand it

How'd it all fall apart?
You were right here before, in my arms
Now you're invisible
But the heartbreak's physical
Got a place, moved away
Somewhere with a different code, different state
Still feels miserable
God, it's so chemical

[Pre-Chorus]
All that I know
Is I can't let you go

[Chorus]
It's been two years and you're still not gone
Doesn't make sense that I can't move on

But this love never dies
Two years since you've been in my bеd
Even had a funeral for you in my head
Yеah, I try, I try, I try, I try
But this love never dies

Another night, another vice
Even try with someone new, someone nice
I'll always hate the fact that you
Ruined everybody after you
I'm always coming back to you
