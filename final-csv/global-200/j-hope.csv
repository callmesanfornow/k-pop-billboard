[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm thirsty
필요해 비트 위 surfin'
난 물 만난 물고기
Soak up the music

춤추는 아기 flow
Keep my passion, I gotta go
I'm still (Not enough)
11년째 독학 중
내 형광 밑줄은 배움의 미학뿐
끝이 없는 학습
부딪히고 넘어지며 나오는 작품
이 위치에서도 make it move
Make it mine, make it right
또 누군가의 favorite song, ha
그게 나의 삶의 반, 삶의 이유, 삶의 낙
원동력으로 carry on (Skrrt!)

귀에 kick snare, 들림 hit that
몸이 쉴 새 없이 직행, make my mixtape
피드백 와도 get back
뭐든 달게 먹는 KitKat 내겐 sweet 해 (Appreciate)
상호 관계, 참 유익해
기름 주입해 주면 drive 해 또 난 beat에
다들 주의해, 나 부주의해
예술이 배인 멋진 그림에 취해, 계속 Dali 들이대
원해 stadium with my fans 아직까지도
쓸어 담어 모든 트로피 그래미까지도
명예 부 다가 아니야 I already, know it
My work makes me breathe, so I want more
Inhale, inhale, exhale, exhale, uh
살아 숨 쉬는 거 같아

[Chorus: j-hope]
I'll tell you again

Don’t ever lose it
‘Cause above all, it's priceless)

Neuron, it responds to my mind
Neuron, it responds to my life
New run, 다시 나를 위한 time
내 신경을 곤두세워, 그때의 나처럼 dive

So 뿌리 깊은 나무, 샘이 깊은 물

살아온 인생이 얼굴 위에 드러날 때
거울에 실눈을 떠 이 정도면 not bad
강직함을 위해 승모에 힘을 뺐어
주어진 수십 가지 motivation
세포와 세포 사이에 이어진 연결고리에서
사는 이유와 의미를 촘촘히 조립해서
세상에 번개 딜리버리 공의 비거리가
짧든지 길든지는 그들이 선택할 몫
이제는 폭탄을 품지 않아
크루에게 공을 돌리고
주말엔 닮은 꼴 아들과 캐치볼
변방에서 메트로
어린 시절 피아노 옆에 메트로놈
그걸 맞추는 게 일이 됐고 쌓이네 곗돈은
여전히 살얼음
미래의 불안감은 유령처럼
무대 밑바닥에서 와있고
소리 질러 외치고 돌아와
집밥의 슴슴한 간으로 휴식해
Make some white noise


[Chorus: j-hope]
I'll tell you again
We'll never ever give up, forever
I'll say it again
