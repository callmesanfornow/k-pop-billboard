I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé & Jisoo]
Lucky me, lucky you 결국엔 거짓말
We lie, (We lie), So what? So what?
만약에 내가 널 지우게 된다면
So sorry (So sorry), I'm not sorry
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 눈물을 감춘 채, eh
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어

[Chorus: All, Lisa & Jennie]
Let's kill this love!
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum

[Bridge: Rosé]
We all commit to love
That makes you cry, oh-oh
We're all making love
That kills you inside, yeah

[Outro: All]
We must kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Before it kills you too
Kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Yeah, it's sad but true
Gotta kill this love (Yeah! Yeah!)
Gotta kill, let's kill this love!","Yeah, yeah, yeah
BLACKPINK in your area
Yeah, yeah, yeah
천사 같은 ""hi"" 끝엔 악마 같은 ""bye""
매번 미칠듯한 high 뒤엔 뱉어야 하는 price
이건 답이 없는 test, 매번 속더라도 yes
딱한 감정의 노예 얼어 죽을 사랑해, eh
Here I come, kick in the door, uh
가장 독한 걸로 줘, uh
뻔하디 뻔한 그 love, love
더 내놔봐 give me some more
알아서 매달려 벼랑 끝에
한마디면 또 like 헤벌레 해
그 따뜻한 떨림이 새빨간 설렘이
마치 heaven 같겠지만
You might not get in it
Look at me, look at you 누가 더 아플까?
You smart? (You smart?) 누가? You are
두 눈에 피눈물 흐르게 된다면
So sorry (So sorry) 누가? You are
나 어떡해 나약한 날 견딜 수 없어
애써 두 눈을 가린 채
사랑의 숨통을 끊어야겠어
Let's kill this love!
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Let's kill this love!
Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum
Feelin' like a sinner
It's so fire with him, I go boo-hoo
He said ""You look crazy""
Thank you, baby
I owe it all to you
Got me all messed up
His love is my favorite
But you plus me
Sadly can be dangerous
Lucky me, lucky you 결국엔 거짓말
We lie, (We lie), So what? So what?

[Intro: All]
(Lovesick girls)
(Lovesick girls)

[Verse 1: Jennie, All]
영원한 밤
창문 없는 방에 우릴 가둔 love (Love)
What can we say?
매번 아파도 외치는 love (Love)

[Verse 2: Lisa]
다치고 망가져도 나
뭘 믿고 버티는 거야
어차피 떠나면 상처투성인
채로 미워하게 될걸
끝장을 보기 전 끝낼 순 없어
이 아픔을 기다린 것처럼

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo, Rosé]
아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
But I don't care, I'll do it over and over
내 세상 속엔 너만 있으면 돼

[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Post-Chorus: Jennie & Rosé]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

[Verse 3: Lisa, Jennie]
No love letters, no X and O's
No love, never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone
To the left, better left alone
Didn't wanna be a princess, I'm priceless
A prince not even on my list
Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo]
아마 다 잠깐 일지도 몰라
우린 무얼 찾아서 헤매는 걸까
불안한 내 눈빛 속에 널 담아
아프더라도 너만 있으면 돼

[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔 없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Post-Chorus: Jennie & Rosé]
But we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
Yeah, we were born to be alone
But why we still looking for love?

[Bridge: Rosé, Jisoo]
사랑은 slippin' and fallin'
사랑은 killin' your darlin'
아프다 아물면 또 찾아오는 이 겁 없는 떨림
들리지 않아 what you say
이 아픔이 난 행복해
나를 불쌍해 하는 네가 내 눈엔 더 불쌍해

[Chorus: All]
We are the lovesick girls
네 멋대로 내 사랑을 끝낼 순 없어
We are the lovesick girls
이 아픔없인 난 아무 의미가 없어

[Interlude: Lisa]
One, two
