All of my girls looking good and they got they own money (Do my, do my ladies run this?)
Pop your shit
This for my girls with no sponsor, they got they own fundin' (Do my, do my ladies run this?)
Not your shit
Run through your city, that motorcade (Do my, do my ladies run this?)
Soon as I enter, they close the gate (Ladies run this?)
Presidential through your residential, bitch, it's nothing

[Pre-Chorus: JENNIE]
Said, ""Fuck your rules,"" is the mood, damn right
Walk in a room and I set the vibe
Get a pic, it'll last you long
Whole team, they gassin' on us
You sit too far down on 'em charts to even ask me who's in charge

[Chorus: JENNIE]
Ridin' 'round, foreign cars (JENNIE)
Top down, starin' at the stars (JENNIE)
Attitude, so don't start shit (JENNIE)

Gimme chi, gimme purr, gimme meow, gimme her, gimme funds
Gimme rights, gimme fight, gimme nerve, gimme cunt, let me serve, rrr
Lemme, lemme out, lemme in
Knock the doors down, got the keys to the Benz
In the boardroom looking bored 'cause I'm not here for pleasin' the men
Not here to reason with them
Misbehaved, Miss Push-My-Pen
I can't tame my passion for him
Can't keep up, what happened to them? (Do my ladies run this?)
Yeah, we lappin' the men (Aw, ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Verse 3: JENNIE & Doechii]
Top of the food chain, bussin' a new chain
This ain't a new thing, no, sir
Money on stupid, hopped in a new whip
You still on my old work (Yeah, yeah)
Work, work, this might hurt (Yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Ha, c'mon, it's gon' be fucking hard

[Verse 1]
Special edition and your AI couldn't copy
I'm leaving clues in the fittin' room and it's hot tea
No, I'm not thinking about no exes, know they miss me
I got the whole room spinning like it's tipsy
Don't bore us, take you to the chorus

They can't deal with me 'cause I'm priceless

Get, get outta my way
바비가 처키가 되기 전에
Name, shame, blame tryna burst my bubble
터트려봐 그럼 더 큰 홀에서
만나는 거야 제니를 keep shading
예술작품엔 필요해 frame이
I've slayed it, and I graved it
Yes, I'm guilty 잘난 게 죄니 (Mmh)

Know you ain't the one, but you might be
Who sent you? Who sent you? Who sent you?

[Verse 2: Dominic Fike, JENNIE, Both]
I had woke up in a daze, my sweat was cold, my lip was cracked
I can't leave this bitch, I had to single, double, triple back
She gon' leave me, but she wants to keep me on, what's up with that?
I don't even really got time for all that shit right now, l'm a baby father
And all them jokes she told at dinner last night ain't had me dead, I was playing possum
And when the waiter brought the check, she said, ""Let's head to mine"" I said, ""Okay, awesome""
One minute, we're growin' apart, and next, I'm in her apartment
Just watchin' her get naked and not thinkin' with my heart
I ain't even really got time for all that shit right now
But if she wanted it right now
Then I could meet you there right now (Now, now, now, now)
Even though you barely even drink (Uh-huh), we hardly even spoke (Uh-huh)

Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty

[Chorus]
This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways

[Verse 1]
Mix me with the drama (Drama)
Check you like commas (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
My clothes are pajamas ('Jamas)
Straight from the cold plunge (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Daytime baddie use her mind
Quick switch of the fit for the night (Night)
Swеrvin' through the lane, we'll bе twenty minute late
'Cause we had to do an In-N-Out drive-by

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not that deep (Deep), I'm not that drunk (Drunk)
Sometimes, girls just gotta have fun
Throw it back, all that ass
Me and my sis, way too attached
It's not that deep (Deep), we're not that dumb (Dumb)
Look at them Bonnies on the run
Inside glowin' like the sun (Sun, s—)
You're gonna feel this every day (Day)

This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways

[Verse 2]
Love what it feel like (Feel like)
To be off of the grid like all night
Oh, with my bih, like (Bitch, like)
We ain't even tryna talk no one
Swerve off all the creeps, no weird vibes
We ain't never let it ruin a good time
Ain't nobody gon' dim our good light
This them words we're livin' by

[Chorus]
This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A. (Ah)
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day (Ah, ah, ah)
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray (Ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways (Ah, ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A. (Ah, ah)
Pretty girls don't do trauma, no new drama, we already got a full day (Ah, ah)
Pretty girls that you gon' remember, know that you could never, nothing ever trigger me (Ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, everyone knows she is me (Ah)


[Outro]
Hahahahahahaha
Pretty","This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways
Mix me with the drama (Drama)
Check you like commas (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
My clothes are pajamas ('Jamas)
Straight from the cold plunge (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Daytime baddie use her mind
Quick switch of the fit for the night (Night)
Swеrvin' through the lane, we'll bе twenty minute late
'Cause we had to do an In-N-Out drive-by
It's not that deep (Deep), I'm not that drunk (Drunk)
Sometimes, girls just gotta have fun
Throw it back, all that ass
Me and my sis, way too attached
It's not that deep (Deep), we're not that dumb (Dumb)
Look at them Bonnies on the run
Inside glowin' like the sun (Sun, s—)
You're gonna feel this every day (Day)
This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways
Love what it feel like (Feel like)
To be off of the grid like all night
Oh, with my bih, like (Bitch, like)
We ain't even tryna talk no one
Swerve off all the creeps, no weird vibes
We ain't never let it ruin a good time
Ain't nobody gon' dim our good light
This them words we're livin' by
This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A. (Ah)
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day (Ah, ah, ah)
Pretty girls packed in a Defender, know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray (Ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways (Ah, ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A. (Ah, ah)
Pretty girls don't do trauma, no new drama, we already got a full day (Ah, ah)
Pretty girls that you gon' remember, know that you could never, nothing ever trigger me (Ah, ah)
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, everyone knows she is me (Ah)
