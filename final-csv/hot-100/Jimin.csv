[Intro]
(I think we could last forever
I'm afraid that everything will disappear
Just trust me)

[Verse 1]
She's saying
Baby, 생각하지 마
There's not a bad thing here tonight
Baby, 떠나도 좋아
있어 줘 오늘까지만

[Verse 2]
Watch me go
날 적셔 밤새도록 (Away)
아침도
취해서 오지 않게

[Pre-Chorus]
시끄러운 음악 속에
희미해진 나
드라마 같은 뻔한 story
익숙해져 가
네가 알던 나를 찾기엔 멀리 온 걸까?
Yeah, I know
You know, I know (Ooh)


[Chorus]
I'd rather be
Lost in the lights
Lost in the lights
I'm outta my mind
이 밤의 끝을 잡아줘
매일 밤
You spin me up high
너를 품은 달
Let me have a taste

[Post-Chorus]
Give me a good ride (Oh, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Oh, it's gon' be a good night (Oh, I'm fallin')
Forever, you and I

[Interlude]
Mmm-hmm
Yeah, hey
Mmm-hmm
Ooh-woah
Mmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm
(Forever, you and I)

[Verse 3]
거울 속에 비친 나
하염없이 미쳐가
I'm feelin' so alive, wasting time


[Chorus]
I'd rather be
Lost in the lights
Lost in the lights
I'm outta my mind
이 밤의 끝을 잡아줘
매일 밤
You spin me up high
너를 품은 달
Let me have a taste

[Post-Chorus]
Give me a good ride (Oh, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
It's gon' be a good night (Oh, I'm fallin')
Forever, you and I

[Outro]
This will break me
This is gonna break me (Break me)
No, don't you wake me (Wake me)
I wanna stay in this dream, don't save me
Don't you try to save me (Save me)
I need a way we (Way we)
I need a way we can dream on (On, on, on)
(Alone again
What's the point?)","(I think we could last forever

We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

[Verse 1]
If every day I think about her
Yeah, every day of my life
Then tell me why I haven't found her
(Why, why, why, why, why?)

There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)
And places to go (There's so many places to go)
I still haven't found your love

I'll take her places they ain't found yet
I'll put it all on the line
I'll be that someone she can count on

[Verse 1: Jimin]
Say, ""oh""
여러분을 위한 harmony
Oh, say, ""love""
자 이제 소개할게
시작된 건 6월 12일
행복을 선물해 매일
Say, ""oh"" (Let's talk about us)

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
전하지 못한 말
숨겨왔던 너의 맘
다 전해줄 거야 (Just for you)
더는 고민하지 마
우리가 함께니까
솔직해져 봐 (Let's go)

[Chorus: Jimin]
Ooh, I love you, babe
다가갈게 너에게
I love you, babe (Yes, Sir)
Ooh, I want you, babe
I wanna hold your hand
I want you, babe


[Verse 2: Loco]
Yeah, uh-huh
반대로 fade away 매일이 새롭게
이름 부를 테니 너는 피어나기만 해줘
우리가 맞춰 jam 해 느낀 대로 계속해
바로 앞에서 말 못 해도 널 위해서 made a band
I've been looking for love
Just for you
빨라지는 속도
난 못 멈춰 (Can't stop)
날짜도 없이 하루 종일
머리 위에 네가 떠 있어
혹시라도 손 대면
난 톡 하고 터져버릴 듯이
커져 love (Let's talk about us)

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
눈부신 하늘과
흩날리는 꽃들도
함께할 거야 (All for you)
So tell me how you feel
그저 느낀 그대로
너를 맡겨봐 (Let's go)

[Chorus: Jimin]
Ooh, I love you, babe
다가갈게 너에게
I love you, babe (Yes, Sir)
Ooh, I want you, babe
I wanna hold your hand
I want you, babe (Take it to the bridge)


[Bridge: Jimin]
막이 오르고 조명이 켜지면
모두가 제자리에
Turn up the music
준비된 것 같아
시작할게 one, two
손 머리 위로

[Outro]
