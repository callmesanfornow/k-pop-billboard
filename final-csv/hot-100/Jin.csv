[Verse 1]
You and me
끝나지 않을 history
Oh, 나의 우주가 돼 준
우리의 이야기
목적지 없이 흘러가는 저 소행성처럼
나도 그저 떠내려가고 있었어
어둠 속에 찾은 나의 모든 dream
새롭게 시작될 story

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
There is no one else
I get heaven to myself
When I'm with you
There is no one else
I feel this way I've never felt

[Verse 2]
You and me
깨지지 않는 별처럼
너의 꿈이 되어
우주를 여행하는
어두운 길을 비춰주는 저 은하수처럼
너는 나를 향해 빛나고 있었어
어둠 속에 찾은 단 하나의 빛
너에게 향하는 나의 길


[Chorus]
When I'm with you
There is no one else
I get heaven to myself
When I'm with you
There is no one else
I feel this way I never felt

[Bridge]
I feel this way I never felt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
When I'm with you
There is no one else
I get heaven to myself
When I'm with you
There is no one else
A life, a sparkle in your eyes
Heaven comin' through

[Outro]
And I love you
And I love you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh","You and me

There's a way
There's a way that we can fly again
Remember how we used to love back then?
Livin' like we had no end
Let's stay out all night
Out all night until we see the sun
Remember how we used to long ago
We can miss the last train home?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you let our love go cold
When we're standing still
We can light it up once more
I'll take you there

[Chorus]
We'll be running wild
Lovin' 'til the sun is out
Running 'til there's nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We'll be running wild
Lovin' like it's made for us
Running 'til there’s nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We’ll be running wild


[Verse 2]
Don't forget
Don't forget about the times we shared
All the places that we used to go
Livin' like we've ruled the world

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you let our love go cold
When we're standing still
We can light it up once more
I'll take you there

[Chorus]
We'll be running wild
Lovin' 'til the sun is out
Running 'til there's nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We'll be running wild
Lovin' like it's made for us
Running 'til there’s nothin' left
'Til our last breath

[Post-Chorus]
We'll be running wild
We'll be running wild
We'll be running wild
We'll be running wild
We'll be running wild","Don't you let our love go cold
When we're standing still
We can light it up once more
I'll take you there
We'll be running wild
Lovin' 'til the sun is out
Running 'til there's nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We'll be running wild
Lovin' like it's made for us
Running 'til there’s nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We’ll be running wild
Don't forget
Don't forget about the times we shared
All the places that we used to go
Livin' like we've ruled the world
Don't you let our love go cold
When we're standing still
We can light it up once more
I'll take you there
We'll be running wild
Lovin' 'til the sun is out
Running 'til there's nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We'll be running wild
Lovin' like it's made for us
Running 'til there’s nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We'll be running wild
We'll be running wild
We'll be running wild
We'll be running wild
We'll be running wild",M,S
