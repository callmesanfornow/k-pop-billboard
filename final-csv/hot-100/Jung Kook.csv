One, two, 3D

[Verse 1: Jung Kook]
I can't touch you through the phone
Or kiss you through the universe
In another time zone
It's the only time I can't reverse
But when there's two dimensions
There's only one I'm missin'
And if you feel alone
You don't have to feel that no more

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
So if you're ready (So if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Uh-uh)
You won't regret me (You won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagnе confetti)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D


[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)
You know how I likе it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)

[Verse 2: Jung Kook]
Body to body to body to body to body
You and me, baby, you know that we got it
So don't go gettin' me started
'Cause you know I get hot-hearted
Baby, oh, baby, oh, baby, you makin' me crazy
Rain, rain, rain, you can't fake it
You give me brand-new emotion
You got me drinkin' that potion

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]
I just wanna see you like that
See you like that, uh-uh

[Chorus: Jung Kook]
So if you're ready (So if you're ready)
And if you'll let me (And if you'll let me)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Hey, show me, girl, now)
You won't regret me (You won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti, hey)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Come on, come on, come on)


[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook]
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (You know how I like it)
3D (Hey; woo)
You know how I like it, girl (You know how I like it)
3D (Woo)
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (Oh, you know how I like it)
3D (Woo)
You know how I like it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)

[Verse 3: Jack Harlow]
I'm on my Jung Kook, take a chick off one look
And when they get took, they don't ever get untook (Woo)
When I seen that body, you would think it was a dead body
The way I told my boys, ""Come look""
I used to take girls up to Stony Brook
And steal they hearts like some crook, true story
Now when I hold somebody's hand, it's a new story
All my ABGs get cute for me
I had one girl (One girl), too boring
Two girls (Two girls), that was cool for me
Three girls, damn, dude's horny
Four girls, okay, now you whorin'
(Hey, hey, hey) I'm loose
I done put these shrooms to good use
I done put my city on my back
And the world know my name, I'm the truth


[Chorus: Jung Kook & Jack Harlow]
So if you're ready
And if you'll let me
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Ooh)
You won't regret me (Won't regret me)
Champagne confetti (Champagne confetti)
I wanna see it in motion
In 3D (Show it to me, girl, now; why?)

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook & Jack Harlow]
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (How do you like it? Right)
3D (Woo)
You know how I like it, girl (Alright, alright)
3D (Woo, woo)
'Cause you know how I like it, girl (You know how I like it; Spy Kids)
3D (Alright)
You know how I like it, girl (Girl)
3D (Woo)

[Outro: Jack Harlow]
I got you playin' with yourself on camera
You my bae, just like Tampa
Speakin' of bucks, I got those
And as for fucks, well, not those
And as for thots, well, do you really wanna know? I thought so
I'll fly you from Korea to Kentucky
And you ain't gotta guarantee me nothin', I just wanna see if I get lucky
I just wanna meet you in the physical and see if you would touch me","I can't touch you through the phone

[Verse 1]
Oh, every day, I wonder if this all is just a dream
Everything falls into place 'cause you're right here with me
Without your love, I'm nothing
You mean more than you know
And words escape me whenever you're close

My pen and paper could never do quite enough
It's the truth, it's the truth
We got something real nothing could brеak

You fill my world with wonder
Everybody needs somebody
