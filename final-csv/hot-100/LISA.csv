(Ooh) If you tried just a little more times
I would've made you a believer
Would’ve showed you what it's like (I would've showed you)
Every single night (Night)

[Verse 1: LISA & RAYE]
In the car, top down, black shades on, uh (Lookin’ so good, can I add?)
And I just broke up with my man, like mm (A very, very silly, silly man)
One ex in the passenger seat 'cause I'm done (Done, yeah, never, ever goin' back)
Down, down, rude boy, get your foot up on my dash
Got all the receipts, I'm a businesswoman
Littlе bit of heartbreak
A little bit of ""How could you do that?""
A littlе bit of talkin' out your ass
A little bit of ""Look at what you had but could not hold""
And that's on you, baby, too bad
I'm about to make it heard as I vroom-vroom
Ice-cold how I leave you ’lone, but please
Tell your mother I’ma miss her so

[Chorus: RAYE & LISA]
If you tried just a little more times
I would've made you a believer
Would’ve showed you what it's like (Like)
Every single night
To be born again, baby, to be born again
If you stayed just another few nights
I could've made you pray to Jesus
Would've showed you to the light (To the light)
Every single night (Every night)
To be born again, baby, to be born again


[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
Non-believer
You’ve bitten from the fruit but can't give back
Nice to leave ya
But I would be a fool not to ask
Do your words seem gospel to ya now? (Your words seem gospel to you now?)
Keepin' me strong
Choosin' to carry on after one
Too many lies would be wrong, so wrong
Said, he popped tags on my shoppin' spree
Stayed mad when I showed him all the long receipts
They laugh, but you crashed out like a comedy
I can't be your sugar mom, get a job for me, shit
(Ah, so) Boy, let go
Or let me live happily forever after more
I hope you learned somethin' from a lil' fiasco
You played the game smart lettin' lil' me pass go 'cause

[Chorus: LISA & RAYE]
If you tried just a little more times
I would've made you a believer
Would've showed you what it's like (Like)

To be born again, baby, to be born again


[Bridge: RAYE]
Seasoned like the cinnamon the way I'm gettin' rid of him
I'm only gonna make you need religion at the minimum
And I'ma do it diligent, I'm lookin' for a synonym
I'm tryna find the words to tell him I ain't even feelin' him (I pray)
Don't ever let me be deficient in
Wish that you could wake up and then take me like a vitamin
I learned the hard way to let go now to save my soul (Oh)

[Intro]
내 뒷모습만 봐도 알잖아
어두워질 때 분홍빛이나
새하얀 조명이 날 깨우면
번쩍번쩍 세상을 흔들어 (Hey!)
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la
What's my name? What's my name? (Hey!)
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la
What's my name? What's my name?

[Verse 1]
머리를 하얗게 비운채
시끄런 감정은 태울래
Burn, burn, burn
그때 난 네 갈증을 해소할 champagne
Sip, sip, 나를 들이켜
그래 더 저 높이 내 body 받들어

[Pre-Chorus]
Want you to ring the alarm, 세상에게 알려
내 이름에다 입맞춰


[Chorus]
Say, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)
Call me, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)
Oh-ooh, 알잖아 attitude
뭘 더 어쩌라구, the loudest in the room (Hoo! Hoo!)
Just say, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)
Call me, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)
Oh-ooh, 알잖아 attitude
뭘 더 어쩌라구, the loudest in the room (Hoo!)

[Verse 2]
Baby, get the megaphone, put it on speaker
I said I can't hear you, so you need to speak up
Put that shit on stereo, everyone else on very low
Protect it like a barrier, promise there's nothing scarier
Than me if anybody coming gunnin' for my man
Gonna catch a case, gun up in my hand
Bam, bam, bam! Hit after hit though
Rocks in my wrist, so I call 'em the Flintstones

[Pre-Chorus]
Ring the alarm, 세상에게 알려
내 이름에다 입맞춰

Say, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)
Call me, ""Lalisa, love me, Lalisa, love me"" (Hey!)

누구와도 비교 못해 그래봤자
You gon' still love me
You need some L-A-L-I-S-A
지금 너의 두 눈 앞에 서있는
내 이름을 기억해
Love you some L-A-L-I-S-A
(Hoo!)

[Verse 3]
You cannot see me, 어떻게 하는지 다 보여줘도 (No)
태국에서 한국 거쳐 여기까지, went for the throat (The throat)
Being the greatest of all time ain't fantasy (Woo!)
새까만 핑크빛 왕관 belongs to we (BLACKPINK)

Tryna say you suffer, oh, don't blame your mother
Elevate, I liberate a new frontier
I'm a new woman","Soak up
All new
So I cut
I go, go to the root
Off to bloom, yeah
Purple into gold
Pain has come and gone again
Walked through that fire
I rediscover
Hit it when I serve, bitch, you better swerve
Revvin' up my au-au-au-au-aura
Focus on my mind, takin' my time
I'm a new woman, woman
Bitch, you better swerve
Revvin' up my au-au-au-au-aura
Focus on my mind, takin' my time
I'm a new woman, woman
Face, eyes, body go wild
You want this? I'm a new woman, woman
Eyes, I'm all about mind
You want this? I'm a new woman
(Uh, mh)
Por to' lo quе soy, yo puedo frontear
No por lo que tеnga siempre me la dan
Y mi energía inmaculá'
Bajo perfil (Y tú 'tás fuera)
Yo vivo pa' cantar, no canto pa' vivir
Nací pura, sí
Ni una era será un flop en mi porvenir
Puta, soy la Rosalía, solo sé servir
La noche estrellá', así sea
Hasta la madrugá', que así sea
Purple into gold (Into gold)
Pain has come and gone again
Walked through that fire
I rediscover
Yo le meto duro, sale bien seguro
Acelero mi a-a-a-a-aura
Yo estoy enfocá', no presiona na'
I'm a new woman, woman
Sale bien seguro
Acelero mi a-a-a-a-aura
Yo estoy enfocá', no presiona na'
I'm a new woman, woman
Face, eyes, body go wild
You want this? I'm a new woman, woman
Eyes, I'm all about mind
You want this? I'm a new woman
Gimme that, gimme that alpha, yuh
Gimme that bigger, the better, uh
Feeding you the bloom growin' out my sleeve
Kissed from a rose, rose, what a, what a meal
Bad luck a sucker, gotta make you tougher
Tryna say you suffer, oh, don't blame your mother
Elevate, I liberate a new frontier
I'm a new woman",F,S
