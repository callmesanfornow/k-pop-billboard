My life's been magic, seems fantastic
I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
Funny when you want it, suddenly you have it
You find out that your gold's just plastic

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day, every night
I've been thinkin' back on you and I
Every day, every night

[Chorus]
I worked my whole life
Just to get right, just to be like
""Look at me, I'm never comin' down""
I worked my whole life
Just to get high, just to realise
Everything I need is on the
Everything I need is on the ground

But I've been wakin' up with your voice in my head
And I'm tryna send a message and let you know
That every single minute I'm without you, I regret it

Call us what we are, toxic from the start
Can't pretend that I was in the dark
When you met my friends, didn't even try with them
I should've known right then

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'

[Chorus]
Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, ""I never wanna see your face""
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end
Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
You heard, ""Baby, can you pull me in closеr?""
You were plotting how to stay in my head
Wе were toxic till the end

[Interlude]
Ladies and gentlemen
I present to you
The ex


[Verse 2]
His favourite game is chess, who would ever guess?
Playing with the pieces in my chest
Now he's on the screen and saying, ""Don't leave""
You stole that line from me

'Cause you're just jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'

I can forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings
I'll never forgive you for one thing, my dear
You wasted my prettiest years
