chk chk boom,stray kids,49,2024-08-02,2024-08-02,1,{'2024-08-02': 49},"[스트레이 키즈 ""Chk Chk Boom"" 가사]

[Intro: Felix]
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom

[Verse 1: Han, Changbin]
(Brrah) 정중앙 흑색의 저 점도
맞춰 내 재빠른 계획도
허점 없이 완벽한 판도
위에서 춤춰 내 plan대로 keep going
Sick of this life, it's regular
승리를 너무 과식했지 배불러 (Ayy, ayy)
산책도 할 겸 허리띠 매 둘러
우린 우주로 나머지 전부 kneel, I'm strong

[Pre-Chorus: I.N, Seungmin, Bang Chan, Han]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 안 되는 것 없이 I do it (Do it)
Just pull out my trigger, I got that (Woo)
I'ma pop, pop, pop, take a shot, yeah
Shoot down my goals one by one, I snipe them
Filling up my truck
Yeah, you want that ride (Boom)
Hit you like a truck
I'ma make you fly

[Chorus: Hyunjin, Lee Know]
(Boom) Vamos, I know that you want it
(Boom) Lobos, we cannot stop hunting
(Boom) Ra-ta-ta-ta, I'ma make it
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom
(Boom) Vamos, I know that you want it
(Boom) Chaos, we so catastrophic
(Boom) Ra-ta-ta-ta, I'ma make it
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom

[Verse 2: Han, Felix, Changbin]
(Boom) Cliché 파괴 자체가 더 cliché
(Boom) 나에 대한 견해 전부 유지해
(Boom) 바뀐 건 없어, I'm not a changed man
내 행보는 여전히 그다음 level에만 대입해
목표치에 한 발씩
한발치 더 다다랐지
I'm the owner of my goal, 주인 잘 만난 복
I make it right, 영점 조준 clear

[Pre-Chorus: I.N, Seungmin, Hyunjin & Felix]
정적을 깨 버리지
나의 trigger, fire (Fire)
저 끝까지 과녁을
더 위로 올려 (My amigo)
Filling up my truck
Yeah, you want that ride (Boom)
Hit you like a truck
I'ma make you fly

[Chorus: Felix, Bang Chan]
(Boom) Vamos, I know that you want it
(Boom) Lobos, we cannot stop hunting
(Boom) Ra-ta-ta-ta, I'ma make it
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom
(Boom) Vamos, I know that you want it
(Boom) Chaos, we so catastrophic
(Boom) Ra-ta-ta-ta, I'ma make it
Boom, boom, chk, chk, boom

[Outro: Hyunjin, Lee Know]
깊이 더 파고들어
My bullet goes 탕탕탕
이건 la vida loca
이건 good shot, shot, shot
깊이 더 파고들어
My bullet goes 탕탕탕
이건 la vida loca

'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops

[Verse 1: Bang Chan]
It only took me a moment
And now I'm imprisoned to your touch (Woah)
I don't know where it's going now
But I know I need your love

[Pre-Chorus: Han]
Now, I'll always be here, I won't ever run
'Cause you took the air right out of my lungs

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
You make my knees drop, it's like I'm in shock

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Now, all I think about is how
My world turned upside down
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops

[Verse 2: Hyunjin, Felix]
Right now, I feel like dying and I'm lying
On the tilings when you walk in the room
Freezing but you're steaming
Yeah, you catch my breath every time you make a move
Can you be a part of my life?
Girl, I need you right by my side
When I look at your eyes
I'm out of breath (I'm out of breath)

My world turned upside down
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops

[Bridge: Felix, Bang Chan, Charlie Puth]
Oh, I feel like there's something comin' over me
I feel like there's something comin' over me
Oh, I feel like there's something comin' over me
Over me, over me
Your lips on my lips make me lose my, ah, ah
Baby, keep 'em there 'til there's no air in my chest
I lose my breath

[Chorus: Han, I.N, Charlie Puth]
Ah, I lose my breath when you're walkin' in
'Cause when our eyes lock, it's like my heart stops (No)
Ah, I lose my breath (Oh, oh) when you're walkin' in (Forget it)
You make my knees drop, it's like I'm in shock (Oh, no)

[Post-Chorus: Lee Know, Seungmin, Bang Chan]
Now, all I think about is how
My world turned upside down (I lose my breath)
Ah, I lose my breath (When you're walkin' in) when you're walkin' in ('Cause when our eyes lock)
