Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know
I know you get the feels (Yeah)
Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know

[Verse 1: Nayeon, Momo, Sana, Tzuyu]
Uh, I'm so curious
’Bout ya boy, wanna keep it cool
But I know everytime you move
Got me frozen, I
Get so shy, it's obvious (Yeah, yeah)
Catching feels like butterflies
If I say what's on my mind
Would I hit bullseye? (Woo)
Shoot! I’m ready, aim and fire (Fire!)

[Refrain: Tzuyu, Jihyo, Dahyun, Nayeon]
Baby, I (Woah, wow)
Feel like Cupid's alive
Ali-i-ive tonight
Yeah, tonight
If your heart beats the same way
Let me know (Yeah, let me know)
'Cause I'm boom-boom-boom
From head to toe and I (From head to toe)

[Pre-Chorus: Mina, Chaeyoung, Jeongyeon]
I know love
It is such a funny thing
A mystery allure
Gotta get to know you more
'Cause I, I can feel a real connection
A supernatural attraction-ah
I got the feels for you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Nayeon, Jihyo]
You have stolen my heart, oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Never let it go-oh-oh
No, never let it go-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Lightning straight to my heart, oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
I got all the feels for sure
Yeah, I got all the feels for ya

[Post-Chorus: Momo, Nayeon, Jihyo]
Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know
I know I get the feels
Boy, I, boy, I, boy, I know
I know you feel it too

[Verse 2: Sana, Tzuyu, Chaeyoung, Dahyun]
(Uh-uh)
Sway in the moonlight, dance in the dark (Yeah, yeah)
I, I know that I caught your eye (That's right)
Are we on the same vibe? (Same vibe)
I wonder what's on your mind
'Cause you got me good and I wanna be ya boo
If it’s dumb, well, I wanna be a fool (Woo, woo, woo!)
Underneath the neon lights, baby
Electricity tonight, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Mina, Chaeyoung, Jeongyeon, Jihyo]
I know love
It is such a funny thing (Yeah)
A mystery allure
Gotta get to know you more (No)
’Cause I, I can feel a real connection (Connection)
A supernatural attraction-ah  (Attraction, ah)
