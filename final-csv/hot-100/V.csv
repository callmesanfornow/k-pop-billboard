[Verse 1]
It's about time we get it straight
Gimme a minute if it ain't too late
대충 무리였나봐, babe
애먼 기분만 해친 채
버티기가 이만큼 힘든데
Stay with me 'til the end of the day

[Chorus]
Maybe we
Could be
Slow dancing
Until the morning
We could be romancing
The night away

[Verse 2]
Turnin' me up and back off like this
What do you want? Do you not like it?
Stop teasin' me, girl
Now, you made me leave my heart out here
날 딛고 올라가
다시 새로 누군가 (Got it on, did you?)
닮았던 우리가
먼 이웃 같은 날


[Chorus]
Maybe we
Could be
Slow dancing
Until the morning
We could be romancing

(Friends)
Ooh

[Verse 1]
You're in my head
I had plans for the weekend (Ah)
But wound up with you instead (Ah)
Back here again (Oh)
Got me deep in my feelings
When I should be in your bed (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I go back to like '09, it's like forever
And you were there my lonely nights, yeah
Keeping me together
So wouldn't it make sense if I was yours?
And you could call me your baby
But we say we're just, say we're just

[Chorus]
Friends, just for now
Yeah, but friends don't say words that
Make friends feel like more than just
Friends, just for now (Just for now)
Now, I'm over pretending
So let's put the ""end"" in friends


[Verse 2]
Friends are not supposed to get too close
And feel emotions that
We're feeling now, now, now
We ain't slowing down, down, down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But once we cross the line
There's no denying you and
I can never turn around, 'round, 'round
Know we'll never be the same (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
In this moment I see you
It always comes around as I believed
When the rain stops you shine on me
Your light's the only thing that keeps the cold out
Moon in the summer night
Whispering of the stars
They're singing like Christmas trees for us

[Chorus]
So, I'll tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside
And I'll tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are

[Post-Chorus]
It's such a strange thing to do
Sometimes I don't understand you
But it always brings me back
To where you are

혹시 아니
너에겐 나만 아는 모습이 있어

Lie with me
By the fire
We can be
Safe from the storms up high
There's a winter ahead
If it's cold and wet
We're always warm here, side by side

Until the spring runs by
And the summer starts to burn
I'll be with you
When the autumn wind returns
Don't you want to say you'll stay?
