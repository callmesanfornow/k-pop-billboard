[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm thirsty
필요해 비트 위 surfin'
난 물 만난 물고기
Soak up the music
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe (Meenie, miney, moe)
춤추는 아기 flow
Keep my passion, I gotta go
I'm still (Not enough)
11년째 독학 중
내 형광 밑줄은 배움의 미학뿐
끝이 없는 학습
부딪히고 넘어지며 나오는 작품
이 위치에서도 make it move
Make it mine, make it right
또 누군가의 favorite song, ha
그게 나의 삶의 반, 삶의 이유, 삶의 낙
원동력으로 carry on (Skrrt!)

[Verse 2]
귀에 kick snare, 들림 hit that
몸이 쉴 새 없이 직행, make my mixtape
피드백 와도 get back
뭐든 달게 먹는 KitKat 내겐 sweet 해 (Appreciate)
상호 관계, 참 유익해
기름 주입해 주면 drive 해 또 난 beat에
다들 주의해, 나 부주의해
예술이 배인 멋진 그림에 취해, 계속 Dali 들이대
원해 stadium with my fans 아직까지도
쓸어 담어 모든 트로피 그래미까지도
명예 부 다가 아니야 I already, know it
My work makes me breathe, so I want more
Inhale, inhale, exhale, exhale, uh
살아 숨 쉬는 거 같아
